abstract = {Over the last 15 years, there has been rapid growth in applications of time-reversal symmetry of wave propagation to enhance communications and imaging through highly scattering media. These techniques exploit both temporal and spatial reciprocity to mitigate signal distortion created from the large number of independent propagation paths between a transmitter and receiver. The time-reversal process is often described by the time-reversal operator (TRO), or equivalently by the multistatic response matrix (MRM), defined by the transmit and receive system. A singular value decomposition of this operator (or MRM) is the starting point for many of the time-reversal imaging techniques. In addition to imaging, this decomposition can also be used to extract information about objects embedded within the propagation medium, i.e., target characterization. In this paper, we review the development of target characterization in time-reversal, with an emphasis on extracting information from small targets. We will analyze the MRM for both acoustic and electromagnetic scattering and show how the symmetry of the target is reflected in the properties of the singular value spectrum. Finally, we discuss several open problems and potential applications.},

abstract = {Recently, a highly efficient midrange wireless transfer technology using electromagnetic resonance coupling has been proposed and has received much attention due to its practical range and efficiency. The resonance frequency of the resonators changes as the gap between the resonators changes. However, when this technology is applied in the megahertz range, the usable frequency is bounded by the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. Therefore, to achieve maximum power transmission efficiency, the resonance frequency has to be fixed within the ISM band. In this paper, an automated impedance matching (IM) system is proposed to increase the efficiency by matching the resonance frequency of the resonator pair to that of the power source. The simulations and experiments verify that the IM circuits can change the resonance frequency to 13.56 MHz (in the ISM band) for different air gaps, improving the power transfer efficiency. Experiments also verified that automated IM can be easily achieved just by observing and minimizing the reflected wave at the transmitting side of the system.},
