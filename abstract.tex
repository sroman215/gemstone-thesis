We investigate the application of time reversed
electromagnetic wave propagation to transmit energy to a moving
target in a reverberant environment. “Time reversal” is a signal
focusing method that exploits the time reversal invariance of the
lossless wave equation to direct signals on a single point inside
a complex scattering environment. In this work, we explore the
properties of time-reversed microwave pulses in a low-loss raychaotic
chamber. We measure the spatial profile of the collapsing
wavefront around the target antenna, and demonstrate that time
reversal can be used to transfer energy to a receiver in motion.
We discuss the results of these experiments, and explore their
implications for a wireless power transmission system based on
time reversal
